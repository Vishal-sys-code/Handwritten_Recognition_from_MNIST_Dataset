# <b>HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION</b>

This is a project to learn handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.<br>

Basically, we will perform classification on various handwritten texts and judge whether they are valid digits or not using the MNIST dataset. <br>

**What is MNIST?** <br>

* MNIST stands for <b><i>Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology</i></b> dataset.

* It is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US causes Bureau.

* All images are labeled with the respective digit they represent.

* MNIST is the hello world of the machine learning. Everytime a ML engineer makes a new algorithm for classification, they would always first check it's performance on the MNIST dataset.

* There are 70k images and each images has 28*28 = 784 features.

* Each image is 28*28 pixels and each features simply represents one-pixel intensity from 0 to 255. If the intensity is 0, it means that the pixel is white and if it is 255, it means it is black.

We will use **Python interactive notebook (ipynb)** to make this ML model. <br>
